            What is "Elo" ?
        </ion-card-header>
        <ion-card-content>

            <b>From Wikipedia:</b>
            <i>The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in
                competitor-versus-competitor games.</i>

            <p>All players start at a baseline of 1200 points. You will take points from your opponent's Elo score by
                defeating them, and vise versa. Defeating a more skilled team will yield higher points than if you beat
                up on a weaker one.</p>

            <p> The higher the score, the more skilled the player. It is extremely difficult to
                maintain a high Elo score, these players are regarded as the best of the best!</p>

            <i>Note: Elo will vary more in your initial games as our system tries to place you in the appropriate tier.
                Over time the system will adjust and the amount of Elo change per game will normalize.</i>

            Why did I gain/lose a different amount of Elo than a teammate in the same game?
        </ion-card-header>
        <ion-card-content>
            <p>
                Most commonly your account, or your teammate's account, is new. New accounts have a higher rate of Elo
                gain and loss to quickly place them into the appropriate league.
            </p>

            <p>
                Otherwise, our actual Elo values have decimal precision.
            </p>

            <p>If you have 1350.91 and your friend has 1290.19 and you guys gain 9.41 Elo from a win, your new value
                will be 1360.32 and your friend's will be 1299.6.</p>

            <p>We round the numbers on display in profiles to make them visually easier to consume, so your new Elo will
                be 1360 [+9 from 1351 rounded value], your friend's will be 1300 [+10 from 1290 rounded value].</p>

            <p>While the site shows you gained 9 and they gained 10, you gained the exact same amount internally.</p>

            <p>
                This is the same reason that an extremely high Elo beating an extremely low Elo can appear as no change
                after the match.
